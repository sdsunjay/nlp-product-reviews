"been buying Planters Lightly Salted Cashews for ages, but recent batches were disappointing. nuts shriveled, black specks, bitter taste like scorched. picked around bad pieces but still tossed nearly 1/3 of the can. nothing else changed, just this recent shipment. normally love these, now debating whether to keep purchasing. hate wasting money.",2,0
"ordered trial bottle of TrimBlast, after 4 days using exactly as instructed, started feeling ill to the point of nausea and vomiting. stopped taking it, yet they shipped another bottle claiming it was part of the sample deal. tossed that one too. weeks later, got charged twice for $64.75, even though I never subscribed. no emails, no invoices. didn't catch charges for two billing cycles because they mask their billing with a fake 20-digit phone number format. wouldn’t advise this product: rough on digestion, sneaky with payments. got $30 back but still lost over $125. not worth it.",1,0

nearly set my apartment on fire.,1,1
"described as 6-input, but only has 4 outputs. terminals insulated, so usable as a junction box, but the listing is misleading. still seems solid, terminals fit, screws feel cheap though—hopefully my boat doesn't burn down.",3,0
"felt fine at first, but lacked support. materials made my feet feel like they were burning.",3,0
"coffee has awful burnt aftertaste, likely from over-roasting. usually enjoy smooth Guatemalan blends.",2,0
"pros: adorable teapot, compliments galore, sturdy, steeper built-in. cons: tiny capacity, fits barely 1.5 mugs worth. no whistle when boiling—leave it, water shoots out spout. handle not heatproof, burn risk if held too long. lid gets hot, often falls off while pouring, nearly hit my foot. looks great but not ideal for daily use.",3,0
"unfortunately, this chair is uncomfortable. wouldn’t buy again. only way to fix it—besides piling 15 cushions on—is to toss it in a bonfire.",1,0
"alarm clock display too bright, even on lowest setting.",2,0
"terrible headphones, left ear stopped working after two days. sound quality poor, overpriced junk.",1,0
"nice-looking ashtray, but I refuse to use it for cigarettes. don’t want to risk burn marks on the wood finish. yes, I know it's an ashtray, still want it looking clean.",4,0

"ordered phone case, color completely different than pictured. feels flimsy.",2,0
"my skin had a terrible reaction to this. applied it and instantly felt burning, redness, puffiness. never had that happen with skincare before. like a mild chemical burn, couldn't wear makeup for days, skin dried out badly. might not be common but definitely test a small area first instead of diving in like I did.",1,1

"electric toothbrush motor weak, bristles wore out fast.",2,0
"thought something was wrong with me medically. turns out it was the toothpaste. optic white formula caused sores, burning lips, tingling tongue, swollen glands at mouth corners. thought it might be yeast, but no. weird metallic taste that won’t rinse away. forums say ingredients like SLS, propylene glycol, sucralose trigger this. some say swollen lymph nodes resolved after switching brands. scary part is the fake toothpaste recalls from last year; could be counterfeits or shady ingredients. either way, avoid this brand. tough to dodge SLS and glycol, but it's a risk.",1,1

"gaming mouse responsive, RGB lights cool, fits hand well.",4,0
"this lotion works great overall. smooth, non-greasy, strong SPF, no redness or irritation even though my skin sometimes reacts badly to creams. hyaluronic acid helps fine lines, small amount goes a long way. price isn't cheap but lower than many brands. only complaint: strong sweet scent that lingers. if you like fragrance, it's fine, but sensitive folks might find it overwhelming. too bad, otherwise excellent.",4,0
"this blender is a beast, crushes ice with ease. loud but works well. would buy again.",4,0
